# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: 2/9/2020
**Today's Progress:** Planning!!

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty excited about this, I'm getting xCode all set up and I ordered a USB-C to lightning cable some I can see this thing in real life. So far my plan is to learn about and build an iOS app. It's a world I'm super unfamiliar with but something that I think could be very useful.
