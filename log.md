# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: 2/9/2020
**Today's Progress:** Planning!!

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty excited about this, I'm getting xCode all set up and I ordered a USB-C to lightning cable some I can see this thing in real life. So far my plan is to learn about and build an iOS app. It's a world I'm super unfamiliar with but something that I think could be very useful.

### Day 0: 2/10/2020
**Today's Progress:** First iOS Spin Up! I opened Xcode and started a project called iDine today. #100daysofcode rules say not to do/count time towards tutorials but I don't really care. I'm here to learn something new. I learned a lot about how iOS project are structed and got a repo started with some data being pulled in using the `decode` modifier.

**Thoughts:** I can tell this will be a challenging process, but I also think it'll be pretty fun to do something so different than my day to day.
