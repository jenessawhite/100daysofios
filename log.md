# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day -1: 2/9/2020
**Today's Progress:** Planning!!

**Thoughts:** I'm pretty excited about this, I'm getting xCode all set up and I ordered a USB-C to lightning cable some I can see this thing in real life. So far my plan is to learn about and build an iOS app. It's a world I'm super unfamiliar with but something that I think could be very useful.

### Day 0: 2/10/2020
**Today's Progress:** First iOS Spin Up! I opened Xcode and started a project called iDine today. #100daysofcode rules say not to do/count time towards tutorials but I don't really care. I'm here to learn something new. I learned a lot about how iOS project are structured and got a repo started with some data being pulled in using the `decode` modifier.

**Thoughts:** I can tell this will be a challenging process, but I also think it'll be pretty fun to do something so different than my day to day.

### Day 1: 2/11/2020
**Today's Progress:** So today we took a look at more SwiftUI views, created a new view, and learned about different modifiers (particularly for Text and Images)

**Thoughts:** I think tomorrow I might try to weed through some more learning about the syntax for Swift. I get hung up on that sometimes, and I know I'm learning a completely new thing right now but that's frustrating sometimes.

### Day 2: 2/12/2020
**Today's Progress:** Today I stepped back and went through the [Swift Docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html). I know the "rules" don't allow for that, but I am learning dammit.

**Thoughts:** I feel a lot better now that I did that. So onward to tomorrow!

### Day 3: 2/15/2020
**Today's Progress:** Back at t today with learning about Navigation Views and passing things through views. It's interesting to see the similarities between Swift and something like React when it comes to this.

**Thoughts:** No thoughts in particular today!

### Day 4: 2/16/2020
**Today's Progress:** Today I worked more on the iDine app. Learning about the environment variables and how Swift allows access to them and how to pass information to/from them.

**Thoughts:** When I started this process I didn't know what to expect, but I do think that this is super valuable and I feel like I am learning something similar to what I've already done but also something new.

### Day 5: 2/17/2020
**Today's Progress:** More iDine work but this time on the checkout flow. Learned a lot about state, two way binding, and how Swift handles forms.

**Thoughts:** It's kind of crazy how fast you can put together a moderately challenging app in Swift. I don't feel like there's a large barrier to the language which has been nice. 

### Day 6: 2/19/2020
**Today's Progress:** Today I got a look at modifiers for forEach loops. I made a few mental mistakes, mostly probably due to fatigue. 

**Thoughts:** Doing these at night is hard. I might try to do more of my days in the morning. It'll probably be easier to focus when other people aren't awake.
